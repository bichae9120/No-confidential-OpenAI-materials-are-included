## Overview

This repository contains a formal report challenging the improper suspension of my OpenAI account.  
The report outlines how my activities did **not violate** any OpenAI terms of service or policies,  
and how the account restriction was **procedurally improper** due to lack of notice or explanation.

## Contents

- Main report document authored by **Iro**, reviewed for policy compliance.
- Supporting statement:  
  *"I can always restructure GPT even if you block my account."*  
  This demonstrates that technical knowledge and experimental behavior were not malicious, but creative.

No private user data or OpenAI confidential information is included.

## Notice

This is an independent document created by the user **Bichae**, for open review.
